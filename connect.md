👋 Hi, I’m Cynthia. I build AI decision systems for high-risk, policy-constrained environments, where accuracy, accountability, and scale all matter.

My work focuses on turning ambiguous, high-impact problems into controllable systems: combining LLM-powered and agentic workflows with human-in-the-loop governance, clear risk boundaries, and measurable quality signals.

I’ve shipped and scaled products across Europe, Asia, and the U.S. at Volvo Cars, SAP, Airwallex, and Alibaba, spanning trade compliance, procurement decision support, cross-border commerce, and payment infrastructure. Across domains, the common thread has been designing AI systems that support better decisions under uncertainty.

I’m particularly focused on:

- AI decision platforms and internal systems at scale
- Trust, safety, and governance for production AI
- Enabling adoption by making AI systems trustworthy

Outside of work, I build small apps and internal tools, and write about technology, career growth, and women in tech.

## Coffee, anyone?

Reach out and let's schedule a chat. Virtual or in-person.
