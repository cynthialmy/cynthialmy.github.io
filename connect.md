ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Cynthia Li, a passionate Software & AI Engineer with a knack for transforming complex data into compelling stories and innovative products. With a rich academic background in Computer Science and Structural Engineering, I've navigated through diverse roles, each teaching me the value of data-driven decision-making and strategic thinking.

## My journey

From spearheading data platform enhancements at Volvo Cars to delving into interactive data visualizations, my journey is about pushing boundaries and embracing challenges. I thrive in spaces that allow me to innovate, collaborate, and contribute to a data-empowered future.

Outside the professional sphere, I'm an avid reader, tech enthusiast, and lifelong learner, constantly exploring new realms of knowledge and technology.

## Coffee, anyone?

Ready to dive into a discussion that could range from the intricacies of data mesh technology to the hidden gems of our next travel destinations? Or perhaps, explore potential collaborations, business ideas, or simply exchange life stories? 

Letâ€™s make it happen. Reach out, and letâ€™s schedule that coffee. Virtual or in-person, I assure you itâ€™ll be a conversation worth your time.
