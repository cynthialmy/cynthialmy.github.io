As mentioned before, I’ve been on a mission to create an app that makes life easier for new parents. Now let me introduce this task management application designed specifically for new parents - akaTask helps parents streamline daily, weekly, and monthly task planning. With advanced AI and a user-friendly interface, akaTask ensures you stay organized, focused, and productive, making parenthood just a bit easier.

# PART B — Product, MVP & Launch (Case Study 2)

# Product Vision

Build the world’s simplest AI productivity assistant for parents: one place to generate, edit, and execute parenting workflows that save time, reduce worry, and connect parents to trusted advice.

### Strategic objectives (12 months)

* Reach 50k installs and 10k MAU within 12 months of launch.
* Achieve 30% 7‑day retention and 15% 30‑day retention for MVP cohort.
* Drive 40% task completion rate for AI-generated task lists within 14 days of activation.
* Validate willingness to pay: 3% conversion to premium in first 6 months.

### Success metrics (North Star and supporting metrics)

* **North Star:** Daily Active Users (DAU) * Task Completion Rate
* **Acquisition:** Installs, Cost Per Install (CPI), organic %
* **Activation:** Time to first task completion, % users who complete generated task list within 48 hours
* **Engagement:** DAU/MAU, average tasks created per user, weekly sessions
* **Retention:** 7-day, 30-day retention
* **Monetization:** Conversion rate to paid tier, LTV, ARPU
* **Trust/Quality:** NPS, % of reviews marked "helpful", average review rating

### How We Chose This Problem

Through extensive user interviews, we identified common pain points and challenges faced by new parents. From these interviews, we identified several Parental Challenges and Pain Points. For more detailed insights, check out my previous post on [Navigating Parenthood: Product Preferences and Parental Challenges](https://cynthialmy.github.io/2024-01-03-new-parents/). 🌟


## User Persona

* **New Parent Nora (Primary):** Time-scarce, tech-comfortable. Wants meal planning + activity generation + mental load reduction.
* **Working Mom Maya:** Needs fast, reliable routines and quick scripts for behavior management.
* **Stay-at-Home Dad Dave:** Seeks variety of activities and structure.

## Core value proposition

Deliver immediate time savings and reduced anxiety via AI-generated, actionable task lists tailored to the family schedule and preferences.

## MVP Scope (v1) — Must-haves

1. **AI Task List Generator** (core): Input: child age(s), day type (workday/weekend), dietary constraints, time availability. Output: prioritized task list (3–8 items) with estimated time and quick actions.
2. **Meal Planner + Grocery List**: Generate 7-day meal plan and categorized shopping list; integrate basic pantry toggles.
3. **Gentle Parenting Script Generator**: Short scripts for common scenarios (meltdowns, setting boundaries, praise) — editable.
4. **Inline Editing & Activation**: Users can edit generated lists and activate a saved list to make it actionable.
5. **Basic Analytics & Tracking**: Track task completion, time to complete, and simple engagement signals for experimentation.
6. **Onboarding & Activation Flow**: Fast onboarding capturing household details and preferences to improve AI relevance.

### MVP Constraints

* No complex device integrations (deferred).
* No payments in v1 (free launch to validate core demand). Monetization experiments start v2.
* Community features are deferred to v2 — focus on AI value first.

## Differentiation vs Competitors

see [Comparing akaTask with Breda and Huckleberry](#comparing-aka-task-with-breda-and-huckleberry) in the [Market Research](#market-research) section for more details.

* **vs Breda:** akaTask integrates logistic tasks (meal planning, grocery lists, task activation) with Breda-style scripts, creating a productivity-first AI assistant instead of a primarily mental-load chat tool.
* **vs Huckleberry:** akaTask is broader — it automates diverse daily parenting workflows beyond sleep tracking.

## Product Features (detailed)

### 1) AI Task List Generator — Product spec

* **Inputs:** child age(s), household constraints (time, dietary), mood, day type (workday/weekend), selected goals (sleep, screen-time, education).
* **Outputs:** 3–8 prioritized tasks with estimated times, rationale for each suggestion, optional quick links (e.g., add to calendar, share to partner).
* **Acceptance criteria:** 70% of test users should rate lists "helpful" or "very helpful" in pilot.

### 2) Meal Planner & Grocery

* One-click generate meal plan + auto categorized grocery list (pantry-aware later).
* Export to shareable checklist and calendar reminders.
* Acceptance: 60% of users use grocery export within first 3 sessions.

### 3) Gentle Parenting Scripts

* Structured templates tuned by age and situation; editable output.
* Acceptance: >60% of users report scripts improved confidence in pilot.

### 4) Analytics & Instrumentation

* Events: `generate_task_list`, `activate_list`, `complete_task`, `edit_task`, `export_grocery`, `script_use`.
* Capture context: child_age, day_type, time_of_day, source_of_activation.

## Data & AI requirements

* Lightweight LLM usage: prompt templates + retrieval of pared-down context (user preferences, recent tasks).
* Safety guardrails: avoid medical/legal advice; include disclaimers and "consult expert" CTA for critical situations.
* Privacy: store minimal PII, GDPR/CCPA ready. Provide clear data usage in onboarding.

## Experiments & Validation plan

1. **Onboarding A/B test** — short (3-question) vs long (detailed preferences) onboarding. Metric: activation (first task completion) within 48 hours.
2. **Task List Length Test** — 3-item vs 6-item lists. Metric: completion rate per list.
3. **Script Prompting UI** — inline prompt vs separate chat. Metric: script adoption and session length.
4. **Grocery Export CTA** — top CTA placement vs inline. Metric: export rate.

## Metrics & Targets (MVP)

* Activation: 40% users complete the first generated list within 48 hours.
* Engagement: DAU/MAU = 25% within first 30 days.
* Retention: 7-day = 30%, 30-day = 15%.
* Task completion rate: 40% average per generated list.

## Go-to-Market & Growth

* **Initial channels:** parenting newsletters, micro-influencers (parent bloggers/podcasters), App Store featuring optimization targeting "parenting" + "productivity".
* **Partnerships:** pediatric clinics for flyer distribution, baby stores for QR codes to try the app in-store.
* **Virality mechanics:** partner sync (share task list), referral reward (premium free month when converted).

## Monetization hypotheses (post-MVP)

* **Premium subscription ($4.99/mo):** advanced personalization (multi-child profiles, pantry sync, calendar integration), prioritized AI generation, advanced analytics.
* **Retail partnerships revenue:** affiliate revenue from recommended items or in-store demo referrals.

## Compliance & Privacy

* No storage of sensitive medical info. If collected (e.g., allergies), keep encrypted and provide clear consent.
* Data retention policy and export/Delete account feature in v1.

## Risks & Mitigations

* **Risk:** Low retention due to low perceived ongoing value.

  * **Mitigation:** Focus on habit loops (daily checklist, reflection prompts), push notifications with meaningful context.
* **Risk:** AI hallucinations; bad advice undermines trust.

  * **Mitigation:** Restrict generative outputs to safe domains (scripts, meal ideas) and add conservative system prompts; human-in-the-loop review for content templates.
* **Risk:** Privacy concerns.

  * **Mitigation:** Transparent onboarding, minimal data collection, clear opt-ins.

## Launch checklist (pre-launch)

* Instrument core analytics events and dashboards.
* Beta test with 200 active parents and gather qualitative feedback.
* App Store metadata and assets optimized for parenting/productivity keywords.
* Support docs and help center (basic FAQs and data privacy page).

## Post-launch measurement & iterating

* Weekly dashboard review for activation and completion metrics.
* Bi-weekly ship cycles for quick fixes and prioritized A/B tests.
* Monthly growth review to evaluate CPI, retention, and engagement against targets.

### Comparing akaTask with Breda and Huckleberry
During our market research, I compared our akaTask app with two leading parenting apps: Breda and Huckleberry. This comparison helped us identify unique features, understand market gaps, and refine our approach to better serve new parents.

[Breda](https://www.bredaapp.com/) is known for its AI-powered ChatGPT capabilities, offering gentle parenting scripts, storytime generators, and guidance on various parenting challenges. It focuses on lightening the mental load of parents by providing immediate AI-generated support. While Breda excels in offering quick solutions for specific situations, akaTask goes further by integrating meal planning, grocery lists, activity planning, and reflection reminders all in one app. This comprehensive approach addresses multiple daily tasks, making it a more holistic solution for busy parents.

- **Features**:
  - AI-powered ChatGPT for gentle parenting scripts.
  - Storytime generators and guidance for parenting challenges.
  - Focus on mental load reduction and providing immediate AI-generated support.
- **Strengths**:

By incorporating features like meal planning, activity generation, and reminders for gentle parenting practices, akaTask addresses the diverse and recurring needs of parents. Our market research highlighted the demand for an all-encompassing app that not only simplifies day-to-day tasks but also supports parents' overall well-being. This comprehensive coverage sets akaTask apart from Breada and Huckleberry, positioning it as a versatile and indispensable tool for modern parenting.

## Wireframing and Design

The wireframing process for akaTask began with meticulous planning and user-centric design. I started by developing a comprehensive sitemap that outlined all the key features and functionalities I wanted to include in the app. This sitemap served as a blueprint, ensuring that our design was well-organized and user-friendly.

![akaTask-checklist](../assets/img/akaPrep0.png)

Next, I created a low-fidelity wireframe to visualize the basic structure and layout of akaTask. This initial wireframe helped us map out the user journey and identify any potential usability issues early on. It was a crucial step in shaping the app's overall design and functionality.

![akaTask-checklist](../assets/img/akaPrep1.png)

To enhance the visual appeal and user experience, I designed a color theme and a initial design system based on our initial user studies. Version one of akaTask featured a vibrant yet soothing palette that resonated well with our target audience. This color scheme was chosen to create a pleasant and engaging user experience, reflecting the app's supportive nature.

![akaTask](../assets/img/akaPrep3.png)

![akaTask](../assets/img/akaPrep4.png)

After finishing the first version prototype, I conducted several follow-up interviews to gather feedback from our users. Based on their input, I simplified and streamlined the design to make it even clearer and more intuitive. Our goal was to minimize complexity and enhance usability, ensuring that parents could easily navigate and utilize all the features of akaTask.

![akaTask-checklist](../assets/img/akaPrep2.png)

To facilitate rapid prototyping and efficient development, I built most of the UI using SwiftUI. This approach allowed us to quickly iterate on the design and incorporate user feedback, leading to a more polished and user-friendly final product. By focusing on simplicity and clarity, we created an app that truly meets the needs of modern parents, making their lives easier and more organized.

## Next

akaTask is still in active development, and we are continuously working to enhance its features and usability based on ongoing feedback from parents. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive, user-friendly solution that addresses the varied needs of modern parenting. We are excited about the progress we’ve made and look forward to sharing more updates soon.
