## Project Overview

Akaboo is an online marketplace dedicated to transforming how parents buy and sell used baby gear, such as strollers and car seats. With a strong commitment to sustainability, safety, and savings, Akaboo addresses a critical gap in the market by offering a trusted platform where parents can access high-quality, pre-owned baby essentials. Our mission is to reduce waste and provide financial relief to families during the crucial early years of parenting.

### The Problem

**Identified Gap:**
The market for used baby gear is fragmented, with no single trusted platform that ensures both safety and quality. Parents face difficulties in finding affordable, high-quality pre-owned baby gear, and there is a lack of streamlined processes for selling such items.

**How We Chose This Problem:**
Through market research and user surveys, we discovered that parents were frustrated with existing platforms due to inconsistent quality, lack of safety assurances, and cumbersome selling processes. This highlighted a significant opportunity to create a solution that addresses these pain points.

### The Solution

**Akaboo Platform:**
Akaboo integrates sustainability, safety, and savings into a single platform. By implementing rigorous safety checks, offering an intuitive user experience, and promoting eco-friendly practices, Akaboo ensures parents can buy and sell used baby gear with confidence and ease.

**Key Features:**
1. **Safety First:** Rigorous vetting process to ensure all items meet safety standards.
2. **User-Friendly Experience:** Intuitive interface for easy listing and purchasing.
3. **Sustainability Score:** Highlights the environmental impact saved by choosing used gear.
4. **Community Support:** Forums and resources for parenting tips and sustainability practices.
5. **Secure Transactions:** State-of-the-art encryption and fraud detection technology.

### Solution Validation Approach

**Pilot Testing:**
We conducted pilot tests with a selected group of parents to validate the platform’s functionality and user experience. Feedback was collected through surveys and user interviews to refine the features and address any pain points.

**Metrics and KPIs:**
- **User Satisfaction:** Measured through feedback and Net Promoter Score (NPS).
