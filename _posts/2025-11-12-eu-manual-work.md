I led the design of a **manual process measurement framework** that enabled Global Process Excellence and Automation teams to establish a common, defensible view of manual effort — one that could scale across 40+ regions.

---

## The Problem

Teams had three main ways of estimating manual work, all with trade-offs:

1. **Self-reported hours** — fast, but subjective.
2. **Stopwatch timing** — precise, but unscalable and unrealistic.
3. **System logs** — objective, but blind to human effort.

We needed a **hybrid approach**: something objective enough for analytics and leadership reporting, yet simple and relatable enough for users to validate themselves.

The measurement framework had to:

* Create a **frozen baseline** before automation begins
* Work across **different process maturity levels**
* Be **defensible** in audits and reviews
* Require **minimal maintenance**

## Insight

After dozens of interviews and workshops, one pattern emerged:

> People didn’t need precision — they needed *consistency and trust*.

When teams could agree on what “manual” meant, even approximate numbers became actionable. The insight shifted our focus from *minutes saved* to *steps removed* — from time measurement to process simplification.

---

## Approach

We built the **Manual Effort Measurement Framework (MEMF)** — a structured but human-friendly model combining **manual baselines** and **system signals**.

### 1. Define the Human Baseline

We measured manual effort per *process*, not per person.

Each process was mapped through workshops:

* **Manual steps & touchpoints**
* **Time bands** (XS–XL, representing <2 to >30 min per step)
* **Frequency** (daily/weekly/monthly)
* **Volatility** (low/medium/high rework variability)

This created a shared, explainable baseline — “human truth” — that was frozen pre-automation.

---

### 2. Layer in System Signals

We then linked automation data — the “system truth”:

* % of transactions completed straight-through (STP)
* Manual override and exception rates
* Volume and throughput trends

The combination allowed us to quantify both **how much manual work existed** and **how automation was reducing it**.

---

### 3. Track Progress via Manual Step Reduction

Automation success was tracked by **manual steps removed or reduced**, rather than time saved.
This made comparisons across regions fair and avoided subjective productivity debates.

---

## Implementation

* Co-created templates and taxonomy with regional process owners
* Ran workshops to validate time bands and touchpoints
* Built dashboards to visualize “Manual Effort Score” (MES) by process
* Integrated with TraceFlow automation tracking for ongoing measurement

## Impact

| Metric               | Result                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Global coverage      | 40+ regions, 100+ process flows mapped           |
| Stakeholder adoption | 90%+ teams validated their own baselines         |
| TraceFlow readiness  | Enabled consistent automation scoping & tracking |
| Leadership reporting | Introduced “% manual steps removed” KPI          |

Beyond metrics, the real win was cultural:
Teams finally had a **shared language** for what “manual” meant — and automation conversations shifted from guesswork to grounded prioritization.

## Reflection

Looking back, this project was less about analytics and more about **designing alignment**.

It taught me that in complex operational environments:

* Simplicity scales better than precision
* Transparency builds more trust than sophistication
* And product managers often need to **design the measurement system** before the product itself

This framework has since become a reference point for measuring manual processes before automation — not as a perfect science, but as a consistent foundation for continuous improvement.
