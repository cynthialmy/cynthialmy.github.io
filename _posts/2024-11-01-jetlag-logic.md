Traveling across time zones is exciting, but jet lag can often steal the joy by leaving us groggy, fatigued, and struggling to adjust. That’s where our app’s jet lag preparation plan steps in, transforming travel experiences by adjusting your body’s internal clock gradually to the new time zone. Here’s a deep dive into how this plan is generated and tailored for all age groups to help you feel refreshed and ready when you arrive.

### How the Jet Lag Preparation Plan Works

Our plan considers key factors that impact your circadian rhythm, or internal clock, which helps manage your body’s daily sleep-wake cycles. When you cross time zones, your circadian rhythm gets out of sync with the new time. By shifting your daily routine in small increments before and during your travel, our app helps reset your body’s clock, allowing you to adapt more naturally to the new time zone.

### Inputs That Guide Your Personalized Plan

For each journey, the app uses these inputs to shape a custom jet lag preparation strategy:

1. **Departure and Arrival Times**: Knowing the specific times at the origin and destination time zones helps in setting up your schedule.
2. **Time Zones Crossed**: Each time zone crossed adds an hour difference to adjust, helping determine the shift your schedule will need.
3. **Days Until Departure**: The number of days you have to prepare determines the pacing of shifts.
4. **Current Sleep Schedule**: Understanding your usual wake-up and sleep times forms the baseline.
5. **Direction of Travel**: Whether you’re going eastward or westward affects whether you need to shift your schedule earlier or later.
6. **Age Group**: Since adults, children, toddlers, and infants all have different sleep needs, your age group defines the shift increments and light exposure recommendations.

With these inputs, the app generates three main strategies to adjust your sleep, light exposure, and meals/activities to support your circadian rhythm’s gradual transition to the new time zone.

### 1. Adjusting Sleep, Nap, and Wake Times

Your sleep adjustments depend on both the direction of travel and your age group. By shifting your sleep schedule in small increments, the app helps you transition to your new time zone smoothly.

#### Logic Table for Sleep Adjustments:

| Age Group | Eastward Travel (Sleep Earlier) | Westward Travel (Sleep Later) |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Adult     | Shift 30-60 min earlier daily   | Shift 30-60 min later daily   |
| Child     | Shift 30-60 min earlier daily   | Shift 30-60 min later daily   |
| Toddler   | Shift 15-30 min earlier daily   | Shift 15-30 min later daily   |
| Infant    | Shift 10-20 min earlier daily   | Shift 10-20 min later daily   |

Based on the number of time zones crossed and your age group, the app calculates a **daily shift increment** and applies it to your sleep schedule as follows:

- **Eastward Travel**: The app gradually shifts your wake-up and sleep times earlier.
- **Westward Travel**: The app gradually shifts your wake-up and sleep times later.

#### Example for Sleep Adjustment:

If you’re an adult crossing three time zones eastward, with four days until your trip, the app might suggest shifting your sleep time earlier by 45 minutes each day. This prepares your body to sleep and wake closer to your destination’s time, easing jet lag upon arrival.

### 2. Light Exposure Recommendations

Light exposure helps reset your circadian rhythm by regulating the production of melatonin, a hormone associated with sleep. For effective adaptation, the timing of light exposure is crucial and is aligned with your travel direction.

#### Logic Table for Light Exposure:

| Direction of Travel | Recommended Light Exposure Time   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Eastward            | Morning (advances internal clock) |
| Westward            | Evening (delays internal clock)   |

In the app:

- **Eastward Travel**: You’ll be encouraged to get **morning light exposure**, which helps advance your body clock, making it easier to fall asleep earlier.
- **Westward Travel**: The app recommends **evening light exposure**, which helps delay your body clock, making it easier to stay awake later.

This gentle exposure to natural light assists your body in adjusting smoothly to your new schedule.

### 3. Meal and Activity Timing Adjustments

Meal timing is another powerful cue that can help your body clock shift. By gradually adjusting meal times toward the destination’s schedule, your body’s digestive rhythm aligns with your new environment.

#### Logic Table for Meal and Activity Timing:

| Direction of Travel | Meal Schedule Shift       | Activity Timing                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Eastward            | Shift meals earlier daily | Morning exercise for alertness |
| Westward            | Shift meals later daily   | Evening exercise for alertness |

In the app:

- **Meal Adjustments**: Meals are scheduled to shift slightly each day, allowing you to adopt the destination’s meal times gradually.
   - For eastward travel, meals shift earlier, supporting an earlier bedtime.
   - For westward travel, meals shift later, aligning with a later bedtime.

- **Activity Timing**: The timing of activities like exercise is adjusted to help your body stay alert at the right times.
   - **Eastward Travel**: Morning exercise is recommended to support an earlier sleep schedule.
   - **Westward Travel**: Evening exercise helps delay sleep onset, aiding in adapting to the destination time.

### How It All Comes Together

Using this data, the app creates a **daily adjustment plan** that includes:

1. **Sleep and Wake Adjustments**: Recommended sleep and wake times for each day before departure.
2. **Light Exposure**: Suggested timing to get outside for natural light exposure.
3. **Meal and Activity Timing**: Adjusted meal times and suggested activity periods to support your new schedule.

By following this structured plan, you’ll be able to transition more naturally into your new time zone, minimizing the effects of jet lag. This way, instead of spending the first few days in a foggy daze, you can jump right into your travel plans feeling rested and ready.

Whether you’re traveling east or west, adjusting to a new time zone doesn’t have to be exhausting. With this personalized plan, your body will feel right at home, no matter where you are in the world.
