Let's consider a mid-sized EU consumer electronics company, importing €80 million worth of components annually and assembling finished products in Central Europe. Historically, the company treated customs as a compliance cost, not as a strategic input.

Their import model looked straightforward:

* Import components from Asia
* Assemble in the EU
* Sell across EU markets

But three customs insights dramatically shifted their economics.

This was a continuation of the work I did for [Border Complexity to Competitive Advantage](../2025-11-02-eu-customs).

## **1. Misclassification: A Hidden 3% Cost Leak**

The company classified a core input under a tariff code with a **3% duty rate**, based on a broad product category. After a classification review, experts determined a more accurate subheading that carried a **0% duty rate** due to a specific CCT provision.

**Impact:**

* Annual import value: €20M
* Duty overpayment at 3%: €600,000
* Savings after correction: €600,000 per year, plus a 3-year retroclaim worth €1.4M

A single classification change boosted annual gross margin by **0.75 percentage points** with no operational change.

## **2. Preferential Origin: Arbitrage Through Supply Chain Design**

The company sourced metal casings from Country A at a competitive price. Under EU rules, products could qualify for **preferential origin** only if less than 40% of ex-works value consisted of non-originating input.

Their casings reflected **48% value from non-originating sources**, disqualifying them.

But by moving a final machining step to Country B, where preferential origin rules allowed **value-added cumulation**, the company brought the effective non-originating share to **28%**, qualifying for 0% duty under an FTA.

**Impact:**

* Annual import value: €25M
* Previous duty rate: 4.2%
* New duty rate: 0%
* Annual savings: ~€1.05M

**Trade-off:**

* Operating cost increased by €120k for new machining
* Net annual gain: €930k

A supply chain designed for origin optimization increased EBITDA more than a 6% price increase would have.

## **3. Inward Processing: Taxing Only the Imported Content**

Previously, the company paid import duty on the **full value of assembled products**, then sold them domestically.

By switching to **inward processing**, they paid duty only on the value of non-EU inputs when the goods were sold in the EU, and no duty at all on goods later exported.

**Impact:**

* Annual domestic sales: €35M
* Imported input share: 40%
* Duty rate: 3%

Under old model:

* Duty base = €35M → €1.05M paid annually

Under inward processing:

* Duty base = €14M → €420k paid annually

Annual savings: **€630k**

# **Economic Summary**

| Intervention                     | Annual Savings      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Classification optimization      | €600,000            |
| Preferential origin optimization | €930,000            |
| Inward processing                | €630,000            |
| **Total**                        | **€2.16M annually** |

In three years, assuming steady imports and no retroactive claims, this company created **€6.5M in margin uplift** without changing its products or pricing.

# **Operational Friction: Why This Doesn’t Happen Automatically**

These gains were only unlocked after a 9-month consulting engagement involving:

* Classification audits
* Origin rule analysis across multiple FTAs
* Supply chain modeling
* Customs authorization applications
* Evidence collection and duty repayment requests

The company had **no internal capability** to identify, simulate, or execute these opportunities.

Customs optimization remained dependent on niche expertise, manual workflows, fragmented data, and slow human decision-making.

# **Agentic AI Opportunity: From Consulting Project to Platform Capability**

Each optimization above can be converted into an **AI-driven capability**:

1. Classification

   * Autonomous classification and tariff testing
   * Automated detection of lower-duty alternatives

2. Origin

   * Supply chain modeling against origin rules
   * Simulation of FTAs, cumulation, and PSR criteria

3. Inward processing

   * Eligibility detection and authorization workflows
   * Automatic duty base calculation

A mature agentic system could continuously monitor product flows and recommend structural changes with quantified business value.

If such a system captured even **30% of potential value automatically**, large importers could unlock **€2–5M of annual EBITDA impact** with no human-led initiative.

In the electronics case above, **automated capture of 30%** of value would still deliver **€650k per year** - the equivalent of a 1.5% gross margin improvement.

# **Why This Matters for Product Strategy**

Customs optimization is not just about compliance.
It is a source of defensible margin, competitive pricing, and working capital efficiency.

Yet today, businesses unlock this value only through expensive, one-off consulting projects.

There is a clear product gap: businesses are structurally under-optimizing because:

* Data is fragmented
* Rules are complex
* Decisions are episodic
* Expertise is scarce
* Errors are costly

Agentic systems can transform customs from a **manual, static cost center** into a **continuous optimization engine** embedded within supply chain and finance workflows, which is a structural advantage in competitive markets with thin margins.
