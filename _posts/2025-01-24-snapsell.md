**SnapSell** is a solo-built, mobile-first AI app that transforms a single photo of an item into a complete resale listing. I designed, built, and animated every part of this project: from UX wireframes and motion interactions to backend architecture and AI integration.

## Inspiration & Problem

As someone who frequently sells second-hand items online, I noticed that the biggest bottleneck wasn’t taking good photos: it was writing the listings. Every platform (Depop, Facebook Marketplace, Poshmark, etc.) requires titles, descriptions, categories, prices, and hashtags. Even for experienced sellers, that meant 5–10 minutes per item. For casual sellers, this friction meant not listing at all.

I wanted to explore whether AI could bridge that gap: using a single photo to generate the full listing block instantly.

**Core Insight:** A single photo already contains most of the metadata a seller needs: object type, color, brand hints, and even condition. With vision models like GPT-4o, it’s possible to extract this and generate human-like text in seconds.

The goal was to simplify the often tedious resale process into a single, delightful action: take a photo → get a polished, platform-ready listing instantly.

## Market & Positioning

SnapSell is built for casual, mobile-first sellers who abandon listings because the text work feels like a chore. The competitive set isn't other AI apps, it's the friction inside existing marketplaces and generic photo editors that still leave users writing copy by hand.

The differentiator is the **photo-first, zero-form flow**: one tap to capture, one tap to copy. That positioning favors speed and emotional payoff over deep listing customization.

## Design Process

## Design Process

### Step 1: Defining the Core Flow

I sketched out the simplest user flow possible: **Upload → Generate → Copy.** Every other feature had to serve this moment. The challenge was to make this fast, intuitive, and emotionally rewarding.

### Step 2: Creating a Friendly Experience with Snappy

While designing early prototypes, I realized the app felt a bit sterile: just another AI tool. To make it more inviting, I created **Snappy**, a cheerful otter mascot who guides users through the process.

I hand-drew Snappy in **Procreate** using soft, rounded shapes and warm tones to give it personality: curious, capable, and friendly. Snappy’s design intentionally mirrors the product’s philosophy: **AI that feels human and supportive, not mechanical.**

To bring Snappy to life, I used **Procreate’s frame animation tools** to draw small motion loops: tail swishes, blinks, and waves: and refined those animations in **Figma** for smooth transitions. When the AI finishes generating a listing, Snappy gives a little celebratory wave: a subtle moment of joy that makes the interaction feel alive.

These touches transformed the app’s tone. Test users mentioned Snappy by name in feedback: one said, *“I feel like the otter just helped me sell something!”* That’s exactly the kind of emotional connection I wanted.

### Step 3: Motion & Microinteractions

Every state change: from upload progress to generation completion: has an intentional animation curve. Using **Expo Reanimated**, I designed transitions that evoke flow and anticipation. Even small movements, like Snappy “thinking” while the AI generates text, help users understand what’s happening behind the scenes.

### Step 4: Technical Architecture Decisions

I built SnapSell using a **FastAPI backend** that connects to **GPT-4o Vision** for photo analysis and text generation. The **frontend**, built with **Expo + React Native**, was optimized for phones first but also works beautifully as a web app.

This setup let me experiment freely: adjusting prompts and seeing instant results on my phone. I could iterate on both the UX and AI model’s tone in real time.

### Step 4: Technical Architecture Decisions

I chose a **FastAPI backend** for its simplicity and async speed, connected to GPT-4o Vision for image-to-text transformation. The **frontend** is built with **Expo + React Native**, designed primarily for mobile but also optimized for web deployment.

This hybrid setup allowed instant iteration: I could tweak the LLM prompt on the backend and immediately see new outputs on my device.

## Product Strategy & Decision Framework

### Problem Hypothesis

If a seller can generate a complete listing from one photo in under 10 seconds, then listing completion increases and abandonment drops, because the most painful step becomes one tap instead of a multi-field form.

### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Strength | Risk | Why Not Chosen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Template builder | Low cost and predictable output | Still requires manual typing | Did not remove the core friction |
| Multi-step form with AI assist | Easier to implement than full vision | Still slow for mobile sellers | Too many steps for casual use |
| Photo-first AI generation | One-step capture and share | Requires stronger model quality | Best alignment with core insight |

### Decision Matrix: Mobile-first vs Web-first

| Criteria | Weight | Mobile-first | Web-first |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Capture speed at listing time | 5 | 5 | 2 |
| Real user behavior | 4 | 5 | 3 |
| Iteration speed for UX | 3 | 4 | 4 |
| Distribution and sharing | 3 | 4 | 4 |
| Total score |  | 62 | 43 |

### Tradeoff Analysis: Instant Use vs Login

| Choice | Benefit | Cost | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Instant use | Lower activation friction and faster testing | Fewer user-level insights | Chosen for MVP |
| Login required | Better retention data and personalization | Higher drop-off at first use | Deferred to v2 |

### Unit Economics Model

To keep the product viable as freemium, I modeled cost per listing against expected value per active user.

**Cost per listing** = Vision call + text generation call + storage + infra
**Value per active user** = (monthly price or ad value) * conversion rate / listings per user
**Target**: cost per listing stays below 10% of value per active user

Worked example (conservative):
- If a user creates 8 listings/month and ARPU is €2.00 with 5% conversion, then value per listing is €0.025.
- That implies a target inference cost of **≤ €0.0025 per listing**, which is why the prompt is tightly scoped and the model call count is minimal.

This model kept the focus on fast iteration without letting inference costs drift above viable thresholds.

## Key Product Decisions

| Decision                    | Why It Matters                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Add Snappy the mascot**   | Builds warmth, trust, and engagement. Users feel guided, not just processed by AI. |
| **Mobile-first design**     | 90% of sellers list via phones. SnapSell had to feel native on small screens.      |
| **Instant use, no login**   | Reduces friction: users can try it instantly.                                     |
| **Hosted backend fallback** | Guarantees mobile users can connect even without local dev setup.                  |
| **Analytics (PostHog)**     | Allowed me to measure where users dropped off and improve flow.                    |

## Reflection

Building SnapSell from scratch was equal parts art and engineering. I got to design a product that not only solves a problem but also **makes users smile**. Snappy, my illustrated otter mascot, became a bridge between human creativity and AI utility: a reminder that tech can be warm, playful, and still incredibly powerful.

This project represents what I love most about product management and development: **turning empathy, design, and technology into experiences people enjoy using.**
