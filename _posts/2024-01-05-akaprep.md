As mentioned before, I‚Äôve been on a mission to create an app that makes life a whole lot easier for new parents, and today, I‚Äôm thrilled to introduce you to akaPrep. My team and I have poured our hearts into this intelligent task management application designed specifically for new parents. AkaPrep helps parents streamline daily, weekly, and ad hoc (which we call "Later") task planning. With advanced AI and a user-friendly interface, akaPrep ensures you stay organized, focused, and productive, making parenthood just a bit easier and a lot more fun. üåü

## Problem Statement

New parents face a multitude of challenges in managing their daily tasks, including meal planning, activity scheduling, and providing emotional support to their children. They often feel overwhelmed by the amount of information and choices available, and struggle to find reliable, expert-backed advice. Additionally, the lack of integrated solutions forces parents to use multiple apps, leading to increased stress and inefficiency.

### How We Chose This Problem

Through extensive user interviews, we identified common pain points and challenges faced by new parents. From these interviews, we identified several Parental Challenges and Pain Points. For more detailed insights, check out my previous post on [Navigating Parenthood: Product Preferences and Parental Challenges](https://cynthialmy.github.io/2024-01-03-new-parents/). üåü

Through these conversations, we discovered that parents are already leveraging AI to aid in their parenting tasks in various ways. These include:

- **Meal Planning and Grocery Lists:** Parents often struggle with meal planning and grocery lists. Each week, coming up with nutritious, toddler-friendly meal ideas can be daunting. AI can generate a weekly vegetarian menu tailored to the foods their toddlers love or tolerate. Within seconds, parents receive a meal plan and a categorized shopping list, making grocery trips more efficient and stress-free.

- **Activity Generator:** For activity planning, minimizing screen time requires a lot of creativity and effort. AI can suggest countless creative activities based on items parents already have at home. Whether for indoor or outdoor fun, AI provides age-appropriate suggestions, ensuring that children stay engaged without the need for excessive screen time.

- **Gentle Parenting Scripts:** When it comes to gentle parenting, finding the right words during a child‚Äôs meltdown can be challenging. AI can help by generating gentle parenting scripts tailored to specific situations, helping parents navigate tough moments with calm and effective communication.

- **Budgeting and Financial Tips:** Budgeting is a task many parents dread. AI can simplify this process by providing personalized financial advice and tips. For instance, parents can ask AI for step-by-step guidance on managing their spending, receiving one question at a time to gradually improve their financial situation.

- **Daily Guided Journal:** Finally, daily guided journaling has been shown to have numerous benefits, but starting the habit can be difficult. AI can assist by engaging in conversations that help parents reflect on their thoughts and feelings, making it easier to practice gratitude and find balance in their motherhood journey.

## User Persona

Certainly! Here are the user personas with added emojis for visual distinction:

### Comparing akaPrep with Breda and Huckleberry
During our market research, I compared our akaPrep app with two leading parenting apps: Breda and Huckleberry. This comparison helped us identify unique features, understand market gaps, and refine our approach to better serve new parents.

[Breda](https://www.bredaapp.com/) is known for its AI-powered ChatGPT capabilities, offering gentle parenting scripts, storytime generators, and guidance on various parenting challenges. It focuses on lightening the mental load of parents by providing immediate AI-generated support. While Breda excels in offering quick solutions for specific situations, akaPrep goes further by integrating meal planning, grocery lists, activity planning, and reflection reminders all in one app. This comprehensive approach addresses multiple daily tasks, making it a more holistic solution for busy parents.

- **Features**:
  - AI-powered ChatGPT for gentle parenting scripts.
  - Storytime generators and guidance for parenting challenges.
  - Focus on mental load reduction and providing immediate AI-generated support.
- **Strengths**:
  - Comprehensive support for emotional and mental aspects of parenting.
  - Easy-to-use AI assistants for quick solutions.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Limited integration of practical daily tasks like meal planning and grocery lists.
  - Focuses primarily on emotional support and less on logistical daily needs.

![performance-checklist](../assets/img/breda.png)

[Huckleberry](https://huckleberrycare.com/), on the other hand, specializes in sleep tracking and improvement, with personalized advice from sleep experts. It helps parents understand their child‚Äôs sleep patterns and offers tailored tips to enhance sleep quality. While Huckleberry provides valuable sleep insights, it primarily focuses on one aspect of parenting. akaPrep distinguishes itself by covering a broader range of parenting needs, including nutrition, activities, and emotional support through gentle parenting scripts and daily reflection prompts.

- **Features**:
  - Sleep tracking and improvement with personalized advice from sleep experts.
  - Detailed tracking of daily schedules and long-term patterns.
  - Focus on sleep solutions and developmental milestones.
- **Strengths**:
  - Strong emphasis on sleep, a critical aspect of child development.
  - Personalized and expert-backed advice.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Narrow focus on sleep-related issues.
  - Lacks comprehensive tools for other daily parenting tasks such as meal planning and activities.

By incorporating features like meal planning, activity generation, and reminders for gentle parenting practices, akaPrep addresses the diverse and recurring needs of parents. Our market research highlighted the demand for an all-encompassing app that not only simplifies day-to-day tasks but also supports parents' overall well-being. This comprehensive coverage sets akaPrep apart from Breada and Huckleberry, positioning it as a versatile and indispensable tool for modern parenting.

## Wireframing and Design

The wireframing process for akaPrep began with meticulous planning and user-centric design. I started by developing a comprehensive sitemap that outlined all the key features and functionalities I wanted to include in the app. This sitemap served as a blueprint, ensuring that our design was well-organized and user-friendly.

![akaPrep-checklist](../assets/img/akaPrep0.png)

Next, I created a low-fidelity wireframe to visualize the basic structure and layout of akaPrep. This initial wireframe helped us map out the user journey and identify any potential usability issues early on. It was a crucial step in shaping the app's overall design and functionality.

![akaPrep-checklist](../assets/img/akaPrep1.png)

To enhance the visual appeal and user experience, I designed a color theme and a initial design system based on our initial user studies. Version one of akaPrep featured a vibrant yet soothing palette that resonated well with our target audience. This color scheme was chosen to create a pleasant and engaging user experience, reflecting the app's supportive nature.

![akaPrep](../assets/img/akaPrep3.png)

![akaPrep](../assets/img/akaPrep4.png)

After finishing the first version prototype, I conducted several follow-up interviews to gather feedback from our users. Based on their input, I simplified and streamlined the design to make it even clearer and more intuitive. Our goal was to minimize complexity and enhance usability, ensuring that parents could easily navigate and utilize all the features of akaPrep.

![akaPrep-checklist](../assets/img/akaPrep2.png)

To facilitate rapid prototyping and efficient development, I built most of the UI using SwiftUI. This approach allowed us to quickly iterate on the design and incorporate user feedback, leading to a more polished and user-friendly final product. By focusing on simplicity and clarity, we created an app that truly meets the needs of modern parents, making their lives easier and more organized.

## Next

akaPrep is still in active development, and we are continuously working to enhance its features and usability based on ongoing feedback from parents. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive, user-friendly solution that addresses the varied needs of modern parenting. We are excited about the progress we‚Äôve made and look forward to sharing more updates soon.
