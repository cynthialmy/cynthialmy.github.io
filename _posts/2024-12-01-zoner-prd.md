As a mom to a 3-month-old and a product manager, I found myself juggling two very different worlds that suddenly collided:
baby sleep schedules and international travel. I knew I needed to find a solution that would help me and my family adjust to the new time zone as quickly as possible.

**Role:** PM + Researcher

**Type:** Concept Case Study

## Where This Idea Began

Anyone who has tried to help a newborn or toddler adjust to time zones knows the ordeal:

- Days of overtired crying

- Parents awake at 3 AM

- Meal times that no longer make sense

Schedules completely derailed

It was clear that jet lag wasn’t just an inconvenience, it created full-family dysfunction.

That’s where this concept began:
Could an app translate circadian science into personalized, actionable plans for families? Not just adults?

## Why Jet Lag Hits Families Harder

Jet lag impacts everyone, but its effects on families are uniquely disruptive.

### For adults:

* Fatigue
* Brain fog
* Irritability
* Reduced productivity

### For babies and children:

* Their circadian systems are still maturing
* Even small disruptions lead to:

  * fussiness
  * difficulty feeding
  * nighttime wake-ups
  * shorter naps
  * increased stress for the entire family

Parents become exhausted and less present during the trip — often wasting the first several days recovering.

Families need more than generic tips.
They need **personalized, step-by-step guidance tailored to age, biology, and travel direction**.

Users need:

* A clear, simple plan that helps them prepare for time zone changes
* Personalized recommendations that adapt to their age, schedule, direction of travel, and circadian biology
* A way to reduce confusion around *when* to sleep, eat, get light, and exercise

Current workarounds (Googled tips, YouTube videos, scattered advice) are inconsistent and not tailored to individual needs.

## Scientific Foundation (and How I Simplified It)

Understanding circadian science is complex, but here’s the core insight I translated into product requirements:

### **Temperature Minimum (t-min)**

A person’s lowest body temperature point — occurring 90–120 minutes before habitual wake time — is the anchor for shifting the internal clock.

### **Light Exposure Sensitivity**

* Light **after** t-min → shifts the clock *earlier*
* Light **before** t-min → shifts the clock *later*
* Midday light has minimal effect (“dead zone”)

### **Small daily shifts > big sudden changes**

Science shows that gradual alignment reduces jet lag severity, especially for children.

### **Meal timing & exercise also shift circadian rhythm**

These auxiliary cues (called zeitgebers) help reinforce the intended shift.

My job as PM + Researcher was to convert this science into **rules**, **logic tables**, and **user-friendly workflows** for parents.

## Product Vision

A mobile app that helps families — babies, toddlers, older kids, and adults — transition smoothly into a new time zone through a personalized, science-backed daily plan.

Instead of trial and error, parents receive **clear, simple guidance**:

* “Tonight, move bedtime 30 minutes earlier.”
* “Get outside for morning light between 8–9 AM.”
* “Shift the first feeding by 15 minutes today.”
* “Today’s nap should be 20 minutes earlier.”

The key design principle:
**Turn complex circadian logic into calm, intuitive daily steps.**

## Target Users

| Segment                                     | Needs                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Parents with infants                        | Tiny, gradual feeding & nap adjustments |
| Parents with toddlers                       | Small bedtime/wake shifts, nap guidance |
| Parents with older kids                     | Clear light and meal schedules          |
| Adults traveling solo                       | Fast, efficient optimization            |
| Caregivers traveling with multiple children | Multi-profile planning                  |

## Inputs the App Collects

### **Trip Inputs**

* Departure and arrival times
* Direction (east/west)
* Number of time zones
* Days until departure

### **User Inputs**

* Age (infant, toddler, child, adult)
* Sleep/wake patterns
* Nap schedule (if applicable)
* Feeding schedule (infants)

These become the “variables” that feed into the personalization engine.

## Jet Lag Personalization Engine (Core Algorithm)

### **Step 1: Estimate Temperature Minimum (t-min)**

Calculated from average wake time minus 90–120 minutes.

### **Step 2: Determine Phase Direction**

* East → phase advance
* West → phase delay

### **Step 3: Assign Daily Shift Amount (by age)**

| Age Group   | Eastward Shift | Westward Shift |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Adult/Child | 30–60 min/day  | 30–60 min/day  |
| Toddler     | 15–30 min/day  | 15–30 min/day  |
| Infant      | 10–20 min/day  | 10–20 min/day  |

### **Step 4: Generate Sleep/Wake Timeline**

Applied across available pre-departure days.

### **Step 5: Layer in Supporting Cues**

* Light timing
* Meal timing
* Feeding shifts (infants)
* Exercise/active play blocks
* Nap adjustments

### **Step 6: Convert Into a Narrative Daily Plan**

Parents receive a simple, human-friendly plan:

> “Today, shift bedtime 20 minutes earlier. Get outside between 8–9 AM. Move the first feeding 10 minutes earlier.”

## App Experience

### **1. Customizable Sleep Plans**

Parents enter:

* travel details
* children’s schedules
* nap frequency
* feeding times

The app produces a day-by-day adjustment plan leading up to the trip.

### **2. Guided Light Exposure**

The app recommends:

* Morning light for eastward travel
* Evening light for westward travel

Notifications are friendly and easy to follow:

> “Time to step outside with your baby for 15 minutes of light exposure.”

### **3. Feeding & Meal Time Adjustments**

For babies:

* 5–20 minute feeding shifts per day

For older kids:

* gradual breakfast/lunch/dinner timing changes
* macronutrient suggestions (protein in AM, carbs in PM)

### **4. Nap & Quiet Time Adjustments**

Age-appropriate nap shifts prevent nighttime disruption.

### **5. Real-Time Reminders & Tracking**

Parents see progress toward destination alignment.

### **6. In-Flight Guidance**

Including:

* When to let baby nap
* How to handle screens
* Sleep-friendly routines on the plane

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

* **Clarity first:** No parent has energy for confusing instructions.
* **Feasible timing:** Shifts must respect age-specific limits.
* **Flexible:** Multiple children with different needs.
* **Emotionally supportive:** Tone must reduce parental stress, not add to it.

---

## Success Metrics

### **Leading Indicators**

* % of users completing onboarding with multiple children
* % following daily adjustment plan
* App retention during travel window

### **Outcome Indicators**

* Users reporting smoother family transition
* Shorter adjustment time upon arrival
* Higher satisfaction compared to “no plan” trips

---

## Future Opportunities

* Wearable integration
* Automatic itinerary import
* Real-time circadian estimation
* A “Family Dashboard” visualizing each member’s readiness

---

## Conclusion

This concept case study showcases how I:

* **translate complex science into actionable product features**, and
* **simplify technical domains into intuitive workflows**, especially for families navigating real-world challenges.

The Jet Lag Shifter helps parents prepare their entire family — from infants to adults — for seamless, restful travel using evidence-based circadian strategies delivered through a compassionate, easy-to-follow digital experience.
