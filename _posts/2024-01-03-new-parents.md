akaTask is an AI-first task management and productivity assistant built for new parents. It consolidates meal planning, activity generation, gentle parenting scripts, and scheduling into a single productivity surface. The product converts parental pain (time scarcity, decision anxiety, clutter, and cognitive load) into measurable value by automating routine decisions and surfacing high-impact, personalized tasks.

This PRD captures the research insights that motivated akaTask (Part A) and defines the product strategy, MVP scope, metrics, feature set, roadmap, launch plan, and validation experiments (Part B).

# PART A - Research & Insights (Case Study 1)

### Research goals

* Quantify parental pain points related to household micro-decisions and time-consuming chores.
* Identify high-value automation opportunities where AI can reduce cognitive load.
* Validate willingness to adopt an integrated productivity tool vs. many single-purpose apps.

### Methods

* Qualitative: 20 one-on-one interviews, 4 focus groups, contextual inquiry in-home (observational notes).
* Quantitative: online survey N=150 parents (mix of new parents and parents of toddlers).
* Competitive benchmarking: Breda (AI scripts), Huckleberry (sleep + tracking), marketplaces for used gear.

### Key data points (from primary research)

* **75%** of parents preferred interactive and bilingual baby monitors - indicating high interest in intelligent device integration.
* **60%** reported frustration with confusing stroller/product terminologies - signals need for simplified product taxonomy and educational UX.
* **80%** emphasized comfortability in baby bottles - proxies for product quality priorities and trust thresholds.
* **70%** rely on recommendations from friends/coworkers for formula choices - strong social influence in decisions.
* **65%** considered used toys high value - cost sensitivity & sustainability opportunity.
* **50%** expressed concern about baby food cost - financial pain that product features can address.

### Themes and implications

1. **High cognitive load & decision anxiety.** Parents fear buying the "wrong" product and waste money/time. Implication: prioritize features that reduce decision friction (AI comparisons, trustworthy reviews, simple taxonomy).
2. **Time scarcity & repetitive chores.** Tasks like meal planning and washing pump parts consume time. Implication: build automation for recurring tasks and TODO templates.
3. **Trust and social proof matter.** Parents value authentic reviews and peer recommendations. Implication: design community/verified-review features and frictionless ways to capture in-app referrals.
4. **In‑person product evaluation preference.** Many prefer seeing items physically. Implication: partner/retailer features (in-store demo locator) and generous return policies to lower purchase risk.
5. **Willingness to adopt AI for narrowly scoped, high-value problems.** Parents used Duolingo/Lovevery and AI for content - good signal for AI-assisted task generation.

### Problem statement (user-centered)

New parents experience a high mental load from hundreds of small decisions and time-consuming household tasks. They need a trustworthy, low-effort system that automatically generates context-aware task lists, reduces repetitive work, and provides quick expert-backed guidance so they can reclaim time and reduce anxiety.

### JTBD (Jobs To Be Done)

* **When** I’m overwhelmed with daily parenting tasks, **I want** a prioritized, ready-to-act task list that fits my day, **so I can** reduce mental load and free time for rest or family.
* **When** I need dinner ideas, **I want** a quick, healthy meal plan and a categorized grocery list, **so I can** minimize planning time and avoid last-minute store runs.
* **When** my child is melting down, **I want** a short, empathetic script tailored to the situation, **so I can** respond calmly and effectively.

### Product Categories
I categorized products into Education, Entertainment, Feeding, Hygiene, Clothing, Safety products, Transportation, and Health products. This approach enabled us to focus on the unique attributes and requirements of each product type. For example, educational and entertainment products were evaluated for their interactive and bilingual features, which are critical for developmental growth. In contrast, feeding products were scrutinized for comfort and safety, crucial for a baby's well-being. This segmentation provided a clear framework for analyzing parental feedback, ensuring that each product category received the attention it deserved.

Here is the information organized into a table:

| **Category**                                          | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Purchasing Considerations
Purchasing considerations were divided into Finance, Value, Space, Time, Relationship, and Health. Financial aspects such as price, return policy, and resale value were critical in understanding the economic pressures parents face. Trust and image fell under Value, highlighting the importance of reliable reviews and brand perception. Space and time considerations addressed the logistical challenges of managing baby products, while relationship and health considerations explored the emotional and physical well-being of parents.

This structured approach during our user interviews proved invaluable. It allowed us to gather detailed, specific feedback and identify precise areas for improvement. Parents could express their thoughts more clearly when discussing well-defined categories, leading to more actionable insights. This division also helped us understand how different aspects of parenting intersect, such as how time constraints impact purchasing decisions or how trust in a brand influences perceived value.
