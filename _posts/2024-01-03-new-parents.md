As a new parent and a product manager, I found myself inundated with information about parenting and newborn care. It felt overwhelming trying to sift through all the advice, products, and reviews. This journey made me realize how crucial it is to understand the experiences and preferences of parents like me. Our user group, composed of parents navigating the same challenges, became an invaluable resource.

I reached out to these parents through surveys, focus groups, and one-on-one interviews. Their candid feedback shed light on their needs, frustrations, and preferences, providing a wealth of information to guide our product development and improvement efforts. Here's what I discovered and how we're planning to act on it.

To better understand the varied needs and experiences of parents, I divided our product categories and purchasing considerations during our user interviews. This segmentation allowed us to gather more targeted and relevant insights, ensuring that I addressed specific concerns within each area.

### Product Categories
I categorized products into Education, Entertainment, Feeding, Hygiene, Clothing, Safety products, Transportation, and Health products. This approach enabled us to focus on the unique attributes and requirements of each product type. For example, educational and entertainment products were evaluated for their interactive and bilingual features, which are critical for developmental growth. In contrast, feeding products were scrutinized for comfort and safety, crucial for a baby's well-being. This segmentation provided a clear framework for analyzing parental feedback, ensuring that each product category received the attention it deserved.

Here is the information organized into a table:

| **Category**                                          | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Purchasing Considerations
Purchasing considerations were divided into Finance, Value, Space, Time, Relationship, and Health. Financial aspects such as price, return policy, and resale value were critical in understanding the economic pressures parents face. Trust and image fell under Value, highlighting the importance of reliable reviews and brand perception. Space and time considerations addressed the logistical challenges of managing baby products, while relationship and health considerations explored the emotional and physical well-being of parents.

This structured approach during our user interviews proved invaluable. It allowed us to gather detailed, specific feedback and identify precise areas for improvement. Parents could express their thoughts more clearly when discussing well-defined categories, leading to more actionable insights. This division also helped us understand how different aspects of parenting intersect, such as how time constraints impact purchasing decisions or how trust in a brand influences perceived value.
