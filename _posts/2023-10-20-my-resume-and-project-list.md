## Diving into My Projects: The Excitement of Creation and Innovation

Embarking on projects that push the boundaries of traditional data use, I've had the exhilarating opportunity to explore, create, and innovate. Let's explore some of the projects that have marked significant milestones in my journey:

## d3-Interaction
**Project Repository:** [d3-Interaction](https://cynthialmy.github.io/d3-Interaction/)

In this project, I focused on enhancing user engagement by implementing various interaction techniques in charts. The goal was to transform static visualizations into dynamic information sources, allowing users to engage with data more meaningfully.

## simple-d3-charts
**Live Demo:** [simple-d3-charts](https://cynthialmy.github.io/simple-d3-charts/)

Here, I went back to the basics, creating a series of straightforward D3.js charts. This project served as a foundation for understanding the core principles of data visualization and a reference point for those new to D3.js.

## course-website-design
**Project Repository:** [course-website-design](https://cynthialmy.github.io/course-website-design/)

This repository was an exciting venture into restyling an existing website for CS 7450. It became a sandbox for experimenting with D3.js, ultimately enhancing the site's interactivity and user experience.

## bridge-dash
**Live Application:** [bridge-dash](https://bridge-dash-90f35a395f88.herokuapp.com/)

BridgeDash stands as one of my more comprehensive projects. This interactive web application offers insights into various aspects of bridges, from distribution to condition ratings. It's a testament to how data visualization can transform raw data into informative, easy-to-understand visuals.

## book_summaries
**Project Insights:** [book_summaries](https://cynthialmy.github.io/book_summaries/)

In this personal endeavor, I delved into the world of data contracts and their significance in maintaining data quality. I shared summaries of insightful books, highlighting universal data challenges and the role of data contracts in addressing them.

## d3-scrollama
**Project Demo:** [d3-scrollama](https://cynthialmy.github.io/d3-scrollama/)

D3-scrollama was a foray into storytelling with data. This demo website showcases how scrollytelling can make data-driven stories more interactive and engaging, providing a narrative context to complex datasets.
