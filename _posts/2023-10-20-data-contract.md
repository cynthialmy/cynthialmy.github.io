### Common Challenges

Some of the key challenges that most companies face that can be solved by data contracts include:

1. **Inconsistency Across Data Sources:** With multiple sources of data, inconsistencies often arise. Data contracts standardize the format and quality of data, ensuring that each data source conforms to a predetermined standard.
2. **Lack of Trust in Data:** It's not uncommon for stakeholders to be unsure about the accuracy or integrity of the data they're working with. Data contracts act as a form of guarantee, assuring that the data meets certain quality and accuracy thresholds.
3. **Ambiguity in Data Interpretation:** Without a clear understanding of what each data point represents, users can interpret data in varied ways. Data contracts define the semantics of data, eliminating ambiguity and promoting a consistent understanding.
4. **Costly Data Cleaning Efforts:** Poor data quality can lead to expensive and time-consuming data cleaning initiatives. By ensuring data quality at the source with data contracts, organizations can minimize or eliminate these additional costs.
5. **Poor Data Integration:** Merging data from different sources can be challenging when there's no standard format or structure. Data contracts facilitate seamless integration by stipulating the format and quality that each data source must adhere to.
6. **Difficulty in Compliance and Auditing:** Ensuring data compliance with industry standards or regulations can be complex. Data contracts can include compliance checkpoints, making audits smoother and reducing the risk of non-compliance penalties.

## One**-Minute Summary**

üí° Explain Data Contract (**Simple Analogy)**

**Imagine a Data Contract as a Promise:**

You and your friend decide to exchange letters. You agree on what information to share, how to write it, and when to send it. This agreement is like a data contract.

1. **What's in the Letter?**
    - **Data Contract**: It details what information is shared, the structure (**Schema**) and additional details (**Metadata**) about the data. It‚Äôs like deciding what stories, news, and updates you‚Äôll put in your letter.
2. **How is it Written?**
    - **Format and Structure**: Just like you‚Äôd write a letter with a greeting, body, and closing, data has a specific way it‚Äôs written and structured so that the other person can understand it.¬†**Versioning**¬†is similar to keeping copies of each letter sent, to track changes over time.
3. **Quality Check:**
    - **Accuracy and Timeliness**: You want to make sure your letter has the correct information (**Data Quality**) and reaches on time (**Service Level Agreement**).¬†**Data Validation**¬†is like proofreading your letter before sending it.
4. **Keeping Promises:**
    - **Trust**: When both sides keep to the agreement, it builds trust. This is similar to¬†**Data Governance**, ensuring everyone is on the same page, building trust between the¬†**Data Provider**¬†and the¬†**Data Consumer**.

### **For a Technical Audience**

**Data Contract as a Formal Agreement:**

A Data Contract is a formal agreement detailing the specification of data exchanged between a Data Provider and a Data Consumer. It serves as the backbone for smooth, reliable, and secure data exchange, involving various key concepts:

1. **Schema and Metadata:**
    - **Specification**: The contract defines the schema and metadata of the data, specifying the format, type, and structure, ensuring that data is consistent and usable.
2. **Data Quality and Integrity:**
    - **Requirements**: It outlines the quality requirements, such as accuracy, completeness, and timeliness, maintaining the reliability and integrity of the data exchanged.¬†**Data Lineage**¬†and¬†**Data Validation**¬†are integral to this process.
3. **Compliance and Governance:**
    - **Standards and Regulations**: The contract addresses compliance with data standards, regulations, and governance policies, mitigating risks associated with data misuse and breaches.¬†**Data Governance**¬†and¬†**Service Level Agreements (SLA)**¬†play crucial roles in ensuring compliance and setting expectations on data availability and quality.
4. **Dispute Resolution:**
    - **Clarity and Accountability**: It provides a clear framework for resolving disputes and ensuring accountability, fostering trust and collaboration between data producers and consumers.

# Deep Dive

## Data Contracts: **Two Main Aspects**

The solution data contracts provide consists of two aspects. 

First, they set up a contract-backed architecture which makes it easier to create and use good quality data through¬†**self-served, autonomous tooling:**

üí° **Aspect 1: Contract-Backed Architecture with Autonomous Tooling**:

- **Foundation of Agreement**: At its core, a data contract is an agreement, a formalized set of rules or guidelines, that describes the expected quality, structure, and other aspects of the data. This helps in ensuring that all parties involved have clear expectations.
- **Facilitating Self-Service**: With data contracts in place, teams and individuals can rely on self-served tools to access and manage data. This self-reliance significantly speeds up processes, as individuals no longer need to wait for approvals or undergo lengthy processes to get the data they need.
- **Enhancing Data Autonomy**: Autonomous tooling implies that these tools are intelligent enough to handle tasks on their own, often with minimal human intervention. This means that tasks like data validation, error-checking, and even some aspects of data transformation can be automated, leading to faster and more efficient data operations.


Second, they facilitate a shift in data culture, emphasizing data explicitly generated to meet use cases, fostering¬†**collaboration between data generators and consumers**, and prioritizing data quality over quantity:

üí° **Aspect 2:** **Cultural Shift Towards Data Utility and Collaboration**:

- **Purposeful Data Creation**: Instead of producing data haphazardly, the emphasis shifts to generating data explicitly crafted to fulfill specific use cases. This means every piece of data serves a clear purpose, aligning with business objectives and reducing data redundancy.
- **Bridging Data Generators and Consumers**: Traditionally, those who produce data (data generators) and those who utilize it (data consumers) may operate in silos. Data contracts promote collaboration between these groups, ensuring that the data produced meets the requirements of those who will be using it. This mutual understanding fosters an environment where both parties work towards shared goals.
- **Quality Over Quantity**: In a data-driven world, it's easy to fall into the trap of accumulating vast amounts of data, thinking more is better. However, sifting through mountains of irrelevant or poor-quality data is counterproductive. Data contracts emphasize the importance of data quality, ensuring that the data collected and stored is of high value, relevant, and actionable.

In essence, data contracts provide a structured framework that not only streamlines data-related processes through **automation** but also promotes a **cultural shift** that prioritizes data's actual utility and quality over mere volume.

## What are the roles related to Data Contracts?

![data-book-summary-3](../assets/img/data-book-summary-3.png)

**1. Data Producers**:

- **Role**: Typically, these are teams or individuals responsible for generating data. This could be an application team logging user interactions, a manufacturing unit recording machine data, or an external partner providing data feeds.
- **Workflow**:
    1. Understand the expectations of data consumers.
    2. Create or modify data sources to meet the terms of the data contract.
    3. Validate and test the data against the contract's specifications before publishing.

**2. Data Consumers**:

- **Role**: These are entities that use the data produced. They could be analysts, machine learning engineers, business decision-makers, or even other systems and applications.
- **Workflow**:
    1. Specify requirements for the data they need.
    2. Review and agree upon the data contract provided by the data producers.
    3. Consume the data and, if discrepancies arise, refer back to the contract to resolve ambiguities or errors.

**3. Data Stewards, Contract Architects (or Data Architects)**:

- **Role**: These individuals ensure the quality, usability, and security of the data. They often act as mediators between producers and consumers and oversee the adherence to data contracts. There might also be experts in designing the structure and stipulations of the data contract. They ensure that the contract is robust, flexible, and catered to both current and future needs.
- **Workflow**:
    1. Facilitate discussions between data producers and consumers.
    2. Review and assist in drafting the data contract.
    3. Monitor adherence to contracts and mediate any issues or discrepancies that arise.
    4. Iterate on the contract with input from stakeholders until a final version is agreed upon.

## What does it mean to you?

### For **Technical Team** üíª

**What Does It Mean?**
To the technical team, a data contract is similar to how a software contract or an API works. Just as APIs have specifications detailing how they should function, data contracts specify how data should be structured, and formatted, and the quality standards it should meet.

**Day-to-Day Impact**:

Having a data contract means that the integration of new datasets into existing systems becomes more streamlined. Instead of manually reviewing and adjusting data, your ETL processes can automatically validate incoming data against the contract. Data pipelines become less prone to breaking due to inconsistent or unexpected data, which in turn reduces system downtimes and debugging sessions.

**Analogy**:
Think of it as writing code with strong typing. Just as you'd want to know the type of a variable before processing it, with data contracts, you'll know the "type" and quality of data you're working with.

**Why Do You Need It?**
Data contracts, when combined with automated validation tools and data quality monitoring systems, help in the early detection of anomalies. This ensures that only clean and compliant data enters your systems. Data cataloging tools that work in tandem with data contracts provide clarity about the data's origin, transformations, and quality, thus making data more discoverable and trustworthy.

**Takeaways**

When data contracts are in place, you will need to make adjustments to your data integration and processing workflows. You should be prepared to ensure the setup of automated validation processes that will inspect incoming data against the contract criteria. This might require you to adopt new tools or adapt existing ones to integrate seamlessly with the data contract's specifications. Further, you'll find it beneficial to have closer collaborations with the data generators and data consumers to ensure that any data produced is in line with the contract from the get-go. As the volume of data continues to grow, proactively embedding these validation and integration checks based on data contracts will save you countless hours in debugging and data cleansing down the road.

### For **Business Team** üìà

**What Does It Mean?**
For the business team, a data contract is like a service-level agreement (SLA) but for data. It ensures that the data they receive meets certain quality and structural standards, much like how an SLA guarantees a level of service.

**Day-to-Day Impact**:

With data contracts in place, reports and dashboards become more reliable. You won‚Äôt have to spend time verifying and cross-checking data sources, or reconciling discrepancies. This leads to quicker insights and the ability to act on them in a timely manner.

**Analogy**:
It's like ordering a customized product. You specify your requirements, and you expect the delivered product to match those. Data contracts ensure your data "deliveries" meet your specifications.

**Why Do You Need It?**
Data visualization tools and business intelligence platforms, when fed with contract-compliant data, yield more accurate representations of business metrics. The integration of data contracts with these platforms ensures that data meets business expectations in terms of quality and structure, leading to more meaningful and actionable insights.

**Takeaways**

With data contracts implemented, your day-to-day operations will be infused with a higher degree of data reliability. However, this also means you need to have a clearer understanding of the specifications outlined in these contracts. It's not just about consuming data; it's about knowing the quality and reliability benchmarks that data adheres to. You'll need to establish more regular communication lines with the technical and compliance teams, ensuring that your data needs and the evolving business requirements are continuously reflected in the data contracts. As you receive more consistent data, you can then focus on making accurate business decisions rather than spending time questioning data integrity.

---

### For **Compliance Team** ‚öñÔ∏è

**What Does It Mean?**
To the compliance team, a data contract represents a binding agreement that ensures data adheres to regulations, privacy laws, and internal policies.

**Day-to-Day Impact**:

Data contracts simplify audit trails. When data is ingested into the system, it's already aligned with regulatory standards. This reduces the need for retrospective adjustments and simplifies compliance reporting.

**Analogy**:
It's like a safety checklist for a manufacturing unit. Before a product rolls out, it needs to meet certain safety standards. Data contracts are your "safety checklist" for data.

**Why Do You Need It?**
Regulatory technology (RegTech) platforms, when combined with data contracts, offer real-time compliance monitoring. They ensure that data entering the systems meets regulatory standards, thus minimizing the risks of breaches. Data masking and tokenization technologies, in coordination with data contracts, also ensure that sensitive information is treated with the utmost care, reinforcing data privacy.

**Takeaways**

As a member of the compliance team, data contracts will become your allies in ensuring regulatory adherence. However, this means you'll need to be actively involved in drafting, reviewing, and updating these contracts. You'll have to work more closely with both the technical and business teams, understanding their requirements and ensuring that the data contracts address regulatory mandates effectively. The static, periodic compliance checks might evolve into real-time monitoring, and you'll need to be adept at using RegTech platforms that align with data contract validations. Your role will be proactive rather than reactive, emphasizing preventive measures over corrective actions.

### For **Strategy and Management Team** üßê

**Day-to-Day Impact**:
Strategies become data-driven, and management can be assured that their strategic decisions are based on a single version of the truth. Forecasting becomes more accurate, and scenario planning becomes more reliable.

**Why Do You Need It & What Technology Enables This?**
Advanced analytics and AI models yield better results when they operate on high-quality data. Data contracts, when integrated with data lakes and analytics platforms, ensure that these models receive data of a predetermined quality and format. This harmonization, in turn, leads to better predictive insights, helping strategy and management teams in proactive decision-making.

**Takeaways**

With the introduction of data contracts, you, in the strategy and management team, will need to place greater emphasis on data-driven decision-making. This means fostering an environment where data accuracy and reliability are paramount. You should familiarize yourself with the nuances of data contracts to understand the foundation upon which your strategic insights are built. Additionally, your engagement with other teams will need to be more frequent, ensuring that the data contracts align with the organization's long-term vision and objectives. While you'll enjoy the benefits of more reliable data, it also necessitates a proactive approach in ensuring that data contracts keep pace with the evolving business landscape.

#### Technical Stack to look into:

- Real-time data ingestion
    - Schema validation:
        - Messages can be serialized using Avro, Protobuf, or JSON-SR
        - [Kafka Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html)¬†can be used to validate the message's schema
- Batch data ingestion:
    - Schema validation:
        - When data arrives, you can validate schema using column and data type checks from¬†[great expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/expectations/expect_column_values_to_be_of_type?filterType=Backend%20support&gotoPage=1&showFilters=true&viewType=Summary).
- Data transformation:
    - Validate data quality:
