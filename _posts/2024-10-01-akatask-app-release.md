I'm thrilled that **akaTask** is officially available on the App Store as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**! This initial release, version 1, focuses on the core function of our app: **task list generation**. We've designed it to streamline task management for busy parents, making it easy to stay organized with a simple, intuitive interface. You can download it here: [akaTask on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/akatask/id6566193664?itscg=30200&itsct=apps_box_link&mttnsubad=6566193664).
