## Project Overview

This project aims to streamline the procurement process at Volvo Cars by integrating Gen AI to facilitate contract management and decision-making. The current system, involving VGS, VPC, and SI+ systems, is fragmented and manual, leading to inefficiencies and risks. Our solution proposes a cohesive AI-driven approach to enhance accuracy, compliance, and efficiency.

### Problem Deep Dive

**The Problem:**
The procurement process is hindered by a lack of integration between systems, leading to time-consuming and error-prone contract management. With over 7,000 contracts, the complexity is substantial, resulting in increased legal and financial risks.

**How We Chose This Problem:**
We identified this issue through stakeholder feedback and analysis of frequent buyer inquiries, where 40% could be addressed with Gen AI. The inefficiencies in contract management highlighted the need for a streamlined solution.

**The Solution:**
Integrating Gen AI with the procurement systems (VGS, VPC, and SI+) to enable natural language queries and automate contract interactions, significantly reducing manual processes and errors.

### Solution Validation Approach

**Approach:**
- **Technology Integration:** Unify systems to work cohesively with Gen AI, ensuring smooth interaction with Microsoft Teams.
- **Process Simplification:** Train procurement teams on AI capabilities and adjust workflows to align with new technology.
- **Cultural Shift:** Emphasize a technology-first approach to enhance efficiency and strategic focus.

**Validation:**
- **Pilot Testing:** Conduct controlled experiments with 10 test users, benchmarking metrics without and with the tool.
- **User Feedback:** Collect qualitative feedback through surveys to refine the chatbotâ€™s functionality and user experience.

### Impact

- **Efficiency Boost:** 25% reduction in time spent on contract searches, reviews, and document preparations.
- **Risk Avoidance:** Enhanced AI search capabilities reduce associated risks, exemplified by an estimated 50-70 million SEK in one case.
- **Improved Data Quality:** Decrease in errors during contract management reinforces legal and financial standards.
- **Employee Morale:** By reducing routine tasks, buyers can focus on strategic initiatives, boosting job satisfaction and productivity.
