Welcome! I’m Mengyuan Li, friends and colleagues call me Cynthia. I’m thrilled that you’ve found your way to my little corner of the internet. Let me take you on a brief journey through my life, highlighting the reasons why we might just be the next great coffee buddies.

### Who Am I?

I’m a Engineer by profession, a problem-solver at heart, and a continuous learner in life. I’ve always been captivated by the power of data and technology and how they intertwine to create solutions that impact societies, businesses, and individuals. My journey wasn’t a straight path; it was filled with late nights, early mornings, challenges, and victories. From diving into computer science to exploring the depths of structural engineering, I’ve indulged my curiosity and learned something valuable at every turn.

### My Professional Path

My career has been a thrilling ride, with each role contributing a new layer to my expertise. I’ve had the privilege of working with global giants like Alibaba Group, where I revolutionized customer complaint mechanisms, and Atkins, where I combined the realms of engineering and data to enhance structural projects.

Currently, I'm part of the innovative team at Volvo Cars, diving into data platforms and mesh technologies. Here, I’m not just a member of a workforce; I’m part of a visionary group shaping the future of automotive industry data.

### Beyond Work

But life isn’t all about work, right? When I step away from the screens and numbers, I indulge in travel, photography, and the endless pursuit of the perfect coffee blend. I’m also an advocate for women in STEM, dedicating time to mentor young talents and occasionally hitting the speaking circuit to share my journey in the hope of inspiring others.

### Why Coffee?

So, why would you want to grab a coffee with me? Because a conversation over coffee is never just about work. It’s about sharing stories, learning from each other’s experiences, and perhaps finding that common ground that ignites a new idea or collaboration. Whether you’re passionate about technology, interested in data-driven changes in the modern world, or looking for insights into navigating a career path that doesn’t fear to tread the road less traveled, I’m here to share that conversation.

Ready to dive into a discussion that could range from the intricacies of data mesh technology to the hidden gems of our next travel destinations? Or perhaps, explore potential collaborations, business ideas, or simply exchange life stories? 

Let’s make it happen. Reach out, and let’s schedule that coffee. Virtual or in-person, I assure you it’ll be a conversation worth your time.
